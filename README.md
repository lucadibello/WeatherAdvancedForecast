# Advanced Weather Forecast:

## Homepage and Forecast

Advanced Weather Forecast (AWF) allows you to get the current and forcasted weather of a given location.
By default, it asks for permission to use your location in order to present to you the weather information relevant to the place you find yourself in.

You can also type in the textfield any other location in the world and, through the use of the Open Weather API, AWF will provide you with the forecast information, if it is available for the selected place.

## Worldwide Analytics

By using data from all over the world, we are ablo to display a large array of charts showing statistics relative to temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and much more. We also wanted to include data regarding pollution, in particular NO2, SO2, O3 and PM2P5 levels.
